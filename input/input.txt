As we can see, the ‘names’ and ‘ages’ columns have been exploded, and new rows have been created for each name and age in their respective lists. The ‘id’ column has been repeated for each new row created by the explosion.
In conclusion, the explode() method in Pandas is a powerful tool that allows for the transformation of nested data into a more usable format. We have discussed how the method works, its syntax, and have explored some examples of how to use it.
By using this method, we can efficiently flatten our data and make it easier to work with, saving time and effort in our data analysis process. We hope that this article has provided you with a good understanding of the explode() method and its applications.Thank you for reading this article.

In this example, we are generating text using the chatbot instance we created earlier, and providing the input “Hello, how are you?”. The output of the chatbot is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing information about the generated text. We are accessing the generated text using the ‘generated_text’ key in the first dictionary, and printing it to the console.
In the second example, we will be using OpenAI’s API to connect to ChatGPT.
To get started, you’ll need to sign up for an API key from the OpenAI website. Once you have your API key, you can use it to make API calls from within your Python code.
